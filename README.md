# 🛡️ First Flight: Personal Audit Repository

***Welcome to my First Flight audit series.***
This repo contains security audits I performed on real or practice smart contracts as part of my learning journey toward becoming a professional auditor.

## 📂 Structure

**Each audit is organized as a separate folder:**
audit-name/
- ├── src/ # Smart contracts with audit annotations (@audit, @gas, @todo)
- ├── test/ # Foundry-based tests (unit, fuzz, invariant)
- │ ├── Contract.t.sol
- │ └── Handler.t.sol
- ├── findings.md # Full write-up of issues, severity, recommendations

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Practice real-world audit structure
- Improve vulnerability discovery & test coverage
- Build a strong audit portfolio from scratch
